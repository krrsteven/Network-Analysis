# Network-Analysis

By utilizing data on international trade, principles of macroeconomics, the concept of social connectedness, and the gravity model, we have developed a web-based platform. This platform offers an instant analysis of trade potentials within Africa, specifically in the context of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The platform incorporates an index that considers both currently traded commodities and those that hold potential for future trade. It serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, development agencies, and entrepreneurs, enabling them to identify and explore promising trade prospects.
